#LODLAM Workshop: Metadata Cleaning Portion Installation Instructions
##Installing OpenRefine or LODRefine
Don't have OpenRefine or LODRefine installed? No worries! We'll get you set up.

###Community Help
Here are some resources and groups that can help with OpenRefine installation issues:

1. Owen Stephens' *Installing OpenRefine* [Recording](https://summit.uwaterloo.ca/p389l6kkluv/) and [Slides](http://www.mashcat.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Installing-OpenRefine.pptx)
2. [OpenRefine 2.6 Official Installation Instructions](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions)
3. [OpenRefine Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openrefine
)

###Java Requirements
OpenRefine is built in Java. You will need “Java SE Runtime Environment” (or JRE) installed - or check that you have the right version installed. *Generally*, 1.7 or 1.8 works.

Follow the [Java Requirement Check and Install instructions here](JavaInstall.md).

###Get OpenRefine or LODRefine
There are 3 options for getting what you need onto your computer. Just choose 1. All methods get you an installation of OpenRefine or LODRefine ready for the workshop.

1. (**Option:** Keep the installation simple (no command lines).)['InstallOptions/Option1.md']
2. (**Option:** Clone a GitHub repository and run LODRefine via command line interface, which can help with debugging. No extensions installation required.)['InstallOptions/Option2.md']
3. (**Option:** Don't install anything and take your chances with a cloud-hosted version over conference wifi.)['InstallOptions/Option3.md']

####Option 3: RefinePro Cloud-Hosted Option
If you want to try a cloud-based version and see if it works for you instead of going through installation instructions above, you can get a free month trial to RefinePro. Follow these steps then make sure it works before calling it quits:

1. Go to [the RefinePro site](https://app.refinepro.com/register/) and register.
2. On that registration page, for the 'Community' portion, choose 'LODLAM'. This will get you an instance of OpenRefine with the DERI RDF Extension installed.
3. When done, enter. You'll get a free month trial.
3. Respond to the email confirmation. This should take you back to the RefinePro login.
4. Logging in takes you to your dashboard. Choose to start an instance - this will create an OpenRefine instance.
5. Once an instance available on your dashboard, click on 'Start'. Once it is starting, click on 'Access this RefinePro instance', a link that appears once your OpenRefine instance is running.
6. This should take you to OpenRefine.
7. You're done (DERI RDF Extension is already present in the DST4L-EU instances).
8. Next step: Go to the ['Test your install section'](OpenRefineInstallationTest.md) and make sure you're ready for the workshop.
