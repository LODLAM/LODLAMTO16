####Option 3: RefinePro Cloud-Hosted Option
If you want to try a cloud-based version, you can get a free month trial to RefinePro. Follow these steps:

1. Go to [the RefinePro site](https://app.refinepro.com/register/) and register.
2. On that registration page, for the 'Community' portion, choose 'LODLAM'. This will get you an instance of OpenRefine with the DERI RDF Extension installed.
3. When done, enter. You'll get a free month trial.
3. Respond to the email confirmation. This should take you back to the RefinePro login.
4. Logging in takes you to your dashboard. Choose to start an instance - this will create an OpenRefine instance.
5. Once an instance available on your dashboard, click on 'Start'. Once it is starting, click on 'Access this RefinePro instance', a link that appears once your OpenRefine instance is running.
6. This should take you to OpenRefine.
7. You're done (DERI RDF Extension is already present).
8. Next step: Go to the ['Test your install section'](../OpenRefineInstallationTest.md) and make sure you're ready for the workshop.
