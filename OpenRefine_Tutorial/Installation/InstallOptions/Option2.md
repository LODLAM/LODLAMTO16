#LODLAM Workshop: Metadata Cleaning Portion Installation Instructions
##Installing OpenRefine or LODRefine

####Option 2: Install LODRefine from GitHub/Source
Alternatively, you can install LODRefine (a version of OpenRefine 2.5 with the DERI RDF extension among others already installed) by downloading or git cloning LODRefine locally.

1. Clone or download LODRefine:
    2. From GitHub, clone the master branch of this [repository](https://github.com/sparkica/LODRefine)
    3. From Sourceforge, [download the most recent version of LODRefine with an installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lodrefine/)
3. Move LODRefine to wherever on your computer you'd like to run it from.
4. Change into that LODRefine directory in some kind of command line interface or client (e.g. Terminal on Mac, Command Prompt in Windows,...), and start LODRefine by typing:
    6. On Mac/Linux:
    ```
    $ ./refine
    ```
    7. On Windows:
    ```
    refine
    ```
6. Leave the Command Line Interface running while working with LODRefine. Go to your preferred web browser (**not Internet Explorer**), and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3333/.
7. When you're done, go back to the Command Line Interface client where LODRefine is running, and type 'cntl+C'. This will stop LODRefine.
8. You're done (DERI RDF Extension is already present in LODRefine).
9. Next step: Go to the ['Test your install section'](../OpenRefineInstallationTest.md).
