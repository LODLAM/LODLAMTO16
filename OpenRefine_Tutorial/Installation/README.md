# LODLAM Workshop: Metadata Cleaning Portion Installation Instructions
## Optional Preparation
This tutorial will primarily work with **OpenRefine** with the **DERI RDF Extension** or **LODRefine** (Linked Open Data OpenRefine) installed. OpenRefine requires Java (see note in OpenRefine Installation instructions) and a web browser to run in (**Not Internet Explorer**).

#### OpenRefine Installation Choices:

1. [Don't have OpenRefine or LODRefine installed yet, or want to try a web-based version available thanks to RefinePro](OpenRefineInstallation.md)
2. [Already have OpenRefine or Google Refine Installed, just need to install DERI RDF Extension](AddDERIExtension.md)
3. [Already have LODRefine or OpenRefine with the DERI RDF Extension installed, just need to test it](OpenRefineInstallationTest.md)

#### Test Your OpenRefine Installation Choice
There is [1 installation test](OpenRefineInstallationTest.md) to make sure you are ready to go on workshop day.

## ENTIRELY OPTIONAL Preparation
[The Optional Preparation document has information on some things you might consider setting up for this workshop, including RDF editors, Python reconciliation services, and Linked Data Fragments Servers](OptionalPrep.md).
